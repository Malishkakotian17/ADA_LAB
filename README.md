🧪 Lab Activities – Analysis and Design of Algorithms<br>

This repository documents the lab activities carried out for the Analysis and Design of Algorithms subject.<br>
The experiments focus on understanding algorithmic thinking, designing step-by-step solutions, writing pseudocode, and implementing logic using Python.<br>

Through these lab sessions, I practiced:<br>

🧠 Logical and analytical thinking<br>

✍️ Algorithm and pseudocode design<br>

🐍 Python program implementation<br>

🛠️ Debugging and optimization techniques<br>

These activities helped strengthen my problem-solving skills and provided hands-on experience in building efficient and structured solutions.<br>
